# STORY-260205-3m4jav: advanced-filter-expressions

## Description
Add support for logical operators in filter: && (AND), || (OR), \! (NOT), and parentheses for grouping. Example: '(auth || login) && \!done'. Parser already implemented in filter.go, needs integration with custom filter UI replacing bubbles/list built-in filter.
