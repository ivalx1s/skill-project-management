# TASK-260206-2d5mgo: trackpad-tap-opens-detail

## Description
Handle trackpad tap (mouse left click) as 'open detail' action — equivalent to pressing Enter. No mouse coordinate tracking needed: tap simply opens detail for the currently selected row (wherever the cursor is). Works like a physical Enter key but triggered by tap. Apply to both agents screen and board screen.
